# WOA clustering

This repo contains an implementation of the Whale Optimization Algorithm for the problem
of clustering with restrictions.

This is the same problem as the clustering problem but we introduce soft restrictions between
points that should be in the same clusters and points that shouldn't be in the same cluster.
